"""Workspace lifecycle: connection and lock ownership (issue #28).

DuckDB holds a single-writer lock: one long-lived read-write connection
blocks every other process's reads. :class:`Workspace` therefore opens
read-only by default, and in ``"rw"`` mode holds **no** persistent
connection at all — every operation acquires a short-lived read-write
connection and releases it promptly, so the file stays readable by other
processes between writes. Nothing at module level opens or caches a
connection, and duckdb itself is imported lazily inside the connect
helper, keeping the package import-pure like its siblings.

Deleted data does not shrink a DuckDB file; :meth:`Workspace.compact`
reclaims space by rewriting into a temp file and atomically swapping it
in, so an interrupted compact always leaves the original intact.
